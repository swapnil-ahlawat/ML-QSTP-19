ASSIGNMENT 1
I have written the code of Cost function and Gradient descent, and they are working fine. I was also able to get the graph of best fit line. 

But there was some software problem in plotting contour plots. One of the mentor suggested some of the soutions to it, I followed them yet I was still getting some error. So at last, he told me to leave it as we didnt have to code anything in it, and it was some software problem.
