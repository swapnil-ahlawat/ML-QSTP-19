ASSIGNMENT 1

I have written the code of Cost function and Gradient descent, and they are working fine. I was also able to get the graph of best fit line, with almost correct theta0 and theta1 values. 

But there was some software problem in plotting contour plots. One of the mentor suggested some of the solutions to it, I followed them yet I was still getting some error. So, at last, he told me to leave it as we didn't have to code anything in it, and it was some software problem.
